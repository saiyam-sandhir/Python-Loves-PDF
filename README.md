<h1>Python Loves PDF</h1>

<p>Python Loves PDF, as the name suggests, is a python project that helps user to work with PDF files easily using a visual interface.</p>

<p>The idea for this project came to me beacuase of my frequent use of PDF files for my assignments. Due to these assignments many times I have go to web and convert images to pdfs or vice-versa, or manipulate the pdfs. A go-to website for me for this purpose is "I Love PDF" so basically Python Loves PDF is an offline version of it that i am making for myself.</p>

<p>Hope you like the project, and maybe in future i will improve upon this project and might add new features or make it capable of doing many other tasks releted to pdfs. Feel free to recommend some ideas by raising issues.</p>
